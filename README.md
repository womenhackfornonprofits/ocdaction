# Setup
## Tools
1. **Terminal**: [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) (MacOSX), [Terminator](http://gnometerminator.blogspot.co.uk/p/introduction.html) (Linux) or use your preffered one.
2. **Text Editor**: [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) or you preffered one.

## Dev Enviroment Setup
1. [Install Git](http://git-scm.com/download/mac)

1. Install [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/):

	```sudo pip install virtualenv```

2. Install [virtualenvwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html): ```sudo pip install virtualenvwrapper```

	If you are on OS X El Capitan, you might get the following error:
	
	```
	Uninstalling six-1.4.1:
		Exception:
      	Traceback (most recent call last):
      	...
      	OSError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/var/folders/7x/h9sy5ff95bl45569k5km9g5m0000gn/T/pip-aWCOxi-uninstall/System/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/Extras/lib/python/six-1.4.1-py2.7.egg-info'
	```
	
	If that happens, re-run the command with the flag `--ignore-installed six`

3. Source the `virtualenvwrapper`:
	```source /usr/local/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh```

	**NOTE**: To help do this automatically on every new shell you open add the line above to your `.bash_profile` or  `.bashrc`

4. Create a new env for the project:

	 ```mkvirtualenv ocdaction```
6. Get the code:

	```git clone git@github.com:womenhackfornonprofits/ocdaction.git```

6. Go inside the `ocdaction` directory:

	```cd ocdaction```

7. Activate the virtual enviroment:

	 ```workon ocdaction```

	 This will now ensure anything you install is within this enviroment.

8. You will need to have [Postgres installed](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) and up and running. You can onstall it via:
	- Homebrew ```brew install postgresql```
	- OR Download the [Postgress App](http://postgresapp.com/)

9. Make sure the Postgres Server is up and running:
	- If using the App simply start the server from there
	- If using command line: ``brew services start postgresql``

9. Install the requirements:

	 ```pip install -r requirements/base.txt```

	 This will get all the dependencies.

9. Create a database locally for the project to run:

	```createdb ocdaction```

10. Go inside frontend folder:

	```cd frontend```

11. Install all the dependencies:

	 ```npm install```

	 This will get all the dependencies


## Running the project locally
1. Go inside the django app directory:

	```cd ocdaction```
2. Run django server:

	```python manage.py runserver```

3. The project is now running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`, go to that address in your browser.
4. You may see a message that you have unapplied migrations, when you see this simply run the command below which will create any tables and fields in the database:

	```python manage.py migrate```


## Front End changes
1. Make css and javascript changes in the ```frontend``` folder
2. Make any HTML changes in the Django templates located in `ocdaction/templates`
3. Use `grunt default` in the frontend folder to build, watch and copy all the required files automatically into the Django static folder.

## Deploying to Heroku
1. Create a Heroku Account
2. Get added to the app in the Heroku Dashboard
3. Download [Heroku toolbelt](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-command-line): `wget -qO- https://toolbelt.heroku.com/install.sh | sh`
3. In the terminal `heroku login`
4. Within you project directory `heroku git:remote -a staging-ocdaction`
5. Once you are ready to deploy, from master branch you can run `git push heroku master` make sure you have commited all the changes before running this and the `git status` is clean.
6. Go to https://staging-ocdaction.herokuapp.com/ to view the live site.
